wait i forgot to do this, i woke up at 6:30. I haven't been consistant in long studying everyday (6h+) like id hoped i would be at the start of this summer. But I have gotten rid of my bad habit, not through willpower but through a change in perspective, its now time to build up the good habits. I dont want anything special I just want to be the best me i can be. 
I think ill build this habit that ill need during school starting yesterday where I work 4.5 hours on topics that are important to me right now and build up every day 5 minutes or 10 minutes until i build up an hour every week to get eventually to 10 hours to mimick what ill have to do duiring school time. Also im trying out books instead of online courses or youtube tutorials, I think books force you to be patient and are nice to have physically
